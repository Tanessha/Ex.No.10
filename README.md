## Aim:

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works using ChatGPT or similar AI models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content’s quality, coherence, and structure.

---

## Algorithm:

1. Start by studying the different **prompt patterns** (query decomposition, decision making, answer engineering, fact check list, tail generation, menu actions, semantic filter).
2. Choose the **content type** (report, article, case study, story, etc.).
3. Design **basic prompts** to generate an initial draft.
4. Refine prompts with advanced techniques such as decision making, tail generation, or semantic filtering.
5. Generate multiple drafts to compare content coherence, accuracy, and creativity.
6. Evaluate the outputs for structure, tone, accuracy, and originality.
7. Iterate and improve prompts until a polished final version is achieved.

## Test Case 2 – **Creative Writing: Sci-Fi Short Story**

### First Draft (Basic Prompt)

*Prompt:* “Write a short sci-fi story.”

**Output:**
In the year 2140, humans lived on Mars. A scientist discovered a strange signal coming from beneath the surface. It turned out to be an ancient alien machine that held secrets of the universe.

---

### Refined Content (Using Tail Generation + Menu Actions)

*Prompt:* “Expand the story with a main character, conflict, and a twist ending.”

**Output:**
Year 2140. On Mars, Dr. Elara Quinn, a young scientist, detected a rhythmic pulse under the red soil. Digging deeper, her team unearthed a dormant alien device. The device started transmitting data — maps of galaxies beyond human reach.
But as the signal spread, Earth governments rushed to claim ownership, sparking a political war. Elara faced a choice: deliver the machine to authorities or protect it from human greed.

### Final Version (With Semantic Filtering for Style + Tail Generation)

**Sci-Fi Short Story: “The Pulse of Mars”**

In 2140, humanity had colonized Mars, turning its dusty plains into research colonies. Dr. Elara Quinn stumbled upon an alien artifact hidden beneath Olympus Mons. The machine pulsed with light, transmitting data that revealed pathways to new galaxies and advanced knowledge.

But soon, competing Earth factions demanded access, each eager to weaponize its secrets. Elara realized the artifact was designed to test civilizations — rewarding only those who sought knowledge, not power.

In a desperate move, she encoded the machine’s data into her DNA and destroyed the device. The universe’s secrets now lived within her, safe from corruption, waiting for a future humanity worthy of them.

📌 *Theme:* The story explores the balance between **curiosity and greed**, showing how technology can either elevate or destroy civilization.
